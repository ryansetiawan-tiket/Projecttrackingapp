## ✨ The Philosophy

We believe **data should tell a story**, not just show numbers.  
We believe **work should be fun**, even when tracking projects.  
We believe **personality matters**, because you're not a robot.

That's why we redesigned the Stats Overview to be:
- **Personal** - Speaks directly to you
- **Playful** - Makes you smile
- **Powerful** - Shows real insights
- **Pretty** - Looks great
