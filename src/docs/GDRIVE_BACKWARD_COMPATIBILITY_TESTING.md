# GDrive Backward Compatibility: Testing Guide

**Date:** Thursday, October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Testing

## 🎯 **Testing Objective**

Verify that old GDrive assets (created before nested folders feature) now display correctly and all tree operations work properly.

---

## 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

### **Test 1: Old Assets Visibility** ⭐ **PRIORITY**

**Setup:**
1. ✅ Load a project with assets created **before** nested folders feature
2. ✅ These assets should have `parent_id: undefined` in localStorage/database

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Old assets appear at **root level** in tree view
- ✅ Assets are visible (not hidden)
- ✅ Folder/file icons display correctly
- ✅ Preview counts show correctly

**How to Verify:**
```
1. Navigate to GDrive tab
2. Look for existing assets
3. Should see: 
   Root/
   ├─ 📄 Old Asset 1 ✅
   └─ 📄 Old Asset 2 ✅
```

---

### **Test 2: Expand All Button** ⭐ **PRIORITY**

**Setup:**
1. ✅ Have at least 1 folder asset (old or new)
2. ✅ Folder should contain children (or be empty)

**Steps:**
1. Click **"Expand All"** button
2. Observe tree expansion

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Button is **enabled** (not disabled)
- ✅ All folders expand to show children
- ✅ Toast shows: "Expanded X folder(s)"
- ✅ Chevron icons change to down position

**Screenshot Reference:**
```
Before Click:
📁 Folder A ▶  (collapsed)

After Click:
📁 Folder A ▼  (expanded)
  └─ 📄 Child File ✅
```

---

### **Test 3: Collapse All Button**

**Setup:**
1. ✅ Expand at least 1 folder first

**Steps:**
1. Click **"Collapse All"** button
2. Observe tree collapse

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All folders collapse (children hidden)

2. ✅ Create NEW folder with nested children
3. ✅ Mix of both in same project

**Expected Tree Structure:**
```
Root/
├─ 📄 Old Asset 1 (parent_id: undefined → null) ✅
├─ 📄 Old Asset 2 (parent_id: undefined → null) ✅
└─ 📁 New Folder (parent_id: null) ✅
   ├─ 📄 New Child 1 (parent_id: "new-folder-id") ✅
   └─ 📄 New Child 2 (parent_id: "new-folder-id") ✅
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Both old and new assets visible
- ✅ Tree indentation correct
- ✅ Folder item counts accurate
- ✅ No duplication

---

### **Test 5: Edit Old Asset**

---

### **Test 7: Delete Folder with Old Assets**

**Setup:**
1. ✅ Move old asset into a folder
2. ✅ Folder now contains old asset + maybe new assets

**Steps:**
1. Click **Delete** on folder
2. Confirm cascade delete

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Warning shows: "This folder contains X item(s)"
- ✅ Cascade delete works
- ✅ Both folder AND old assets deleted
- ✅ Toast: "Deleted X item(s)"

---

### **Test 8: Search Old Assets**

**Steps:**
1. Type search query in search bar
2. Search for old asset name

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Old assets appear in search results
- ✅ Match count accurate
- ✅ Highlight on matching text
- ✅ Auto-expand parent folders if needed

**Example:**
```
Search: "mockup"

Results:
✅ Found 2 matching assets

```

---

### **Test 9: Folder Item Count**

**Setup:**
1. ✅ Create folder
2. ✅ Add old assets as children
3. ✅ Add new assets as children

- ✅ Includes old assets in total
- ✅ Folder count correct
- ✅ File count correct

---

### **Test 10: Add Child to Folder (Old Asset Context)**

**Setup:**

**Steps:**
1. Click **Add Child** button on old folder
2. Fill form
3. Save

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ "Add Child" button works on old folders
- ✅ Parent locked to old folder
- ✅ New asset added successfully
- ✅ Tree updates with new child

---

### **Test 11: Parent Selector Dropdown**

- ✅ Buttons responsive
- ✅ No double-tap issues

---

## 🔍 **Console Inspection**

### **Check Normalized Data:**

Open browser console and run:

```javascript
// In React DevTools, find GDriveAssetManager component
// Check normalizedAssets value

// Should see:
normalizedAssets: [
  { 
    id: "old-1", 
    asset_name: "Old Asset", 
    parent_id: null  // ← Was undefined, now null ✅
  },
  { 
    id: "new-1", 
    asset_name: "New Asset", 
    parent_id: null  // ← Always was null ✅
  }
]
```

---

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

**All tests pass if:**

1. ✅ **Visibility:** Old assets appear at root level
2. ✅ **Expand All:** Button works and expands all folders
3. ✅ **Tree Structure:** Correct indentation and hierarchy
4. ✅ **CRUD Operations:** Edit, delete, move work on old assets
5. ✅ **Search:** Old assets searchable and highlightable
6. ✅ **Counts:** Folder item counts accurate
7. ✅ **Parent Selector:** Old folders appear in dropdown
8. ✅ **Keyboard Nav:** Works seamlessly with old assets
9. ✅ **No Errors:** Zero console errors or warnings
10. ✅ **Performance:** No slowdown with mixed old/new assets

---

## 🐛 **Common Issues & Fixes**

### **Issue 1: Old Assets Still Not Visible**

**Cause:** Assets have `parent_id: undefined` but normalization not applied

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Check if normalizeGDriveAssets is imported
console.log(normalizeGDriveAssets);

// Check if called before buildTree
const normalizedAssets = normalizeGDriveAssets(assets);
const tree = buildTree(normalizedAssets);
```

**Fix:** Ensure `normalizedAssets` is used in `buildTree()` call

---

### **Issue 2: Expand All Does Nothing**

**Cause:** No folders detected OR folders have no children

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Check folder count
const folders = assets.filter(a => a.asset_type === 'folder');
console.log('Folders:', folders);

// Check if folders have children
folders.forEach(f => {
  const children = getChildren(normalizedAssets, f.id);
  console.log(`${f.asset_name} has ${children.length} children`);
});
```

**Fix:** Ensure folders exist AND have children

---

### **Issue 3: Duplicate Assets in Tree**

**Cause:** Both original and normalized assets rendered

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Check if tree is built from normalized assets
const tree = buildTree(normalizedAssets); // ✅ Correct
const tree = buildTree(assets); // ❌ Wrong
```

**Fix:** Always use `normalizedAssets` for `buildTree()`
