# GDrive Multiple Preview Feature - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive support for multiple preview images for GDrive folder-type assets, featuring carousel display and lightbox functionality.

## Key Features

### 1. **Type Definition Updates** (`/types/project.ts`)
- Added `preview_urls?: string[]` field to `GDriveAsset` interface
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing `preview_url` for single file assets

### 2. **GDrive Asset Manager** (`/components/GDriveAssetManager.tsx`)

#### Multiple File Upload Support
- **Folder type**: Accepts multiple image files via file input
- **File type**: Single image file (existing behavior)
- Validation: Max 5MB per image, image types only

#### New Functions
- `uploadMultiplePreviews()`: Batch upload multiple preview images
- Updated `handleAddAsset()`: Handles both single and multiple preview uploads
- Updated `handleSaveEdit()`: Supports adding more previews to existing folders
- Updated `handlePreviewFileChange()`: Smart file handling based on asset type

#### UI Enhancements
- Dynamic file input label: "Preview Thumbnail" vs "Preview Thumbnails"
- `multiple` attribute on file input for folder type
- Preview count display: "Selected: 3 image(s)"
- View mode shows first preview with "+N" badge overlay
- Edit mode allows adding more previews to existing folders

#### Preview Management
- Updated `handleRemovePreview()`: Handles removal of all previews (single or multiple)
- Confirmation dialog shows count of previews being removed
- Cascading delete from Supabase Storage

### 3. **GDrive Page** (`/components/GDrivePage.tsx`)

#### State Management
- Added `selectedPreviewIndex` state for tracking current preview in carousel
- Integrated with existing `selectedAssetIndex` for asset navigation

#### New Helper Functions
```typescript
getAssetPreviewUrls(asset): string[]  // Returns array of all preview URLs
navigateToNextPreview()               // Next preview in same folder
navigateToPreviousPreview()           // Previous preview in same folder
```

#### Asset Card Display
- **Preview count badge**: Shows "X photos" badge for folders with multiple previews
- **Smart click behavior**:
  - Folders with previews → Open lightbox
  - Folders without previews → Open GDrive link
  - Files with previews → Open lightbox

#### Lightbox Enhancements

##### Single Counter System
- **Image counter**: "Image 2 / 8" - Shows current position in carousel
- Only appears when folder has multiple previews

##### Navigation Controls
- **Large chevron buttons**: Navigate between images in carousel
- Desktop only - Mobile uses swipe gestures
- Disabled states when at first/last image

##### Keyboard Navigation
- **Left/Right arrows**: Navigate between images in carousel
- **Escape**: Close lightbox

##### Image Display
- Dynamically loads preview based on `selectedPreviewIndex`
- Maintains zoom level when switching previews
- Error handling for failed image loads

## Usage Flow

### Creating Folder with Multiple Previews
1. Select asset type: "Folder"
2. File input shows "Preview Thumbnails" with `multiple` attribute
3. Select multiple images (Ctrl/Cmd + Click)
4. See confirmation: "3 image(s) selected"
5. Upload → All previews saved to Supabase Storage

### Viewing in GDrive Page
1. Folder card shows first preview + "3 images" badge
2. Click thumbnail → Opens lightbox
3. See image counter: "Image 1 / 3"
4. Use arrow buttons or Left/Right keys to browse images
5. Swipe left/right on mobile to navigate

### Editing Existing Folder
1. Edit mode shows existing preview count
2. Label: "Upload new to add more"
3. Select more images → Appends to existing previews
4. Remove button: "Remove All (3 previews)"

## Technical Details

### Backend Integration
- Uses existing `/gdrive/upload-preview` endpoint
- Unique asset ID suffix: `${assetId}-${index}` for each preview
- Returns signed URLs from Supabase Storage

### Data Structure
```typescript
// Folder with multiple previews
{
  asset_type: 'folder',
  preview_urls: [
    'https://...signed-url-1',
    'https://...signed-url-2',
    'https://...signed-url-3'
  ]
}

// File with single preview (backward compatible)
{
  asset_type: 'file',
  preview_url: 'https://...signed-url'
}
```

### Fallback Behavior
- Folders without previews: Show default Google Drive folder icon
- Click behavior: Direct link to GDrive (no lightbox)
- Maintains existing functionality for all edge cases

## Benefits

1. **Better Context**: Stakeholders can see multiple screenshots/previews from a folder
2. **No Extra Clicks**: Browse all previews without opening GDrive
3. **Simple Navigation**: Single-level carousel navigation focused on current folder content
4. **Mobile Optimized**: Swipe gestures work smoothly
5. **Backward Compatible**: Existing single-preview folders continue to work
6. **Scalable**: No limit on number of previews per folder
