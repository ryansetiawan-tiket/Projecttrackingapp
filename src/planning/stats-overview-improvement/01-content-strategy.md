# Content Strategy - Stats Overview Redesign 📝

**Purpose:** Define all copy, messaging, and storytelling for the redesigned Overview tab.

---

## 🎯 Content Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Talk to a Human, Not a User**
   - Use "you" and "your"
   - Write like you're texting a friend
   - Celebrate wins, joke about struggles

2. **Context Over Numbers**
   - Never show a metric alone
   - Add comparison, meaning, or humor
   - Make data relatable

3. **Show Personality**
   - Light humor and wit
   - Emoji accents (not spam)
   - Playful but not unprofessional

4. **Keep It Real**
   - Use actual data
   - Don't exaggerate or minimize
   - Honest about good and bad

### **2. 💡 Highlights (Main Insights)**

#### Structure
4 storytelling cards with dynamic content:

#### **🔥 Top Category (Vertical)**
```
Template:
"🔥 Top Category: {verticalName} — {count} out of {total} projects ({percentage}%) are pure {verticalName} grind {emoji}"

Examples:
"🔥 Top Category: Loyalty — 8 out of 16 projects (50%) are pure loyalty grind 💛"
"🔥 Top Category: Growth — 5 out of 12 projects (42%) powering the growth machine 🚀"
"🔥 Top Category: Disco — 6 out of 10 projects (60%) — party mode activated 🪩"

Fallback (if tied):
"🔥 Top Categories: {vertical1} & {vertical2} — perfectly balanced, as all things should be ⚖️"

No vertical data:
"🔥 Categories are nicely spread out — no clear favorite yet! 🎨"
```

#### **⚡ Fastest Project**
```
Template:
"⚡ Fastest Project: {projectName} — finished in record time ({days} days)!"

Examples:
"⚡ Fastest Project: Blackpink Campaign — finished in record time (3 days)!"
"⚡ Fastest Project: Q4 Promo Assets — speedrun champion at 2 days! 🏃‍♂️"

Variations by speed:
// 1-3 days
"⚡ Fastest Project: {name} — blink and you'd miss it ({days} days)! ⚡"

// 4-7 days
"⚡ Fastest Project: {name} — wrapped up in just {days} days! 🎯"

// 8+ days (but still fastest)
"⚡ Fastest Project: {name} — the speedy one at {days} days! 🏃"

Fallback (no completed projects):
"⚡ No completed projects yet — the race hasn't started! 🏁"
```

#### **👥 Most Active Collaborator**
```
Template:
"👥 Most Active Collaborator: {name} — found in {count} {simultaneous/total} projects {emoji}"

Examples:
"👥 Most Active Collaborator: Agung — found in 3 simultaneous projects 😂"
"👥 Most Active Collaborator: Misbeh — contributing to 5 projects total 🌟"
"👥 Most Active Collaborator: Dira — everywhere at once in 4 projects! 🦸"

Variations:
// If in 3+ simultaneous projects
"👥 Most Active: {name} — juggling {count} projects at once! 🤹"

// If in 5+ total projects
"👥 MVP: {name} — contributed to {count} projects! 🏆"

// If tied
"👥 Dream Team: {name1} & {name2} — both crushing it with {count} projects! 🤝"

Fallback (solo work):
"👥 Solo mode activated — you've got this! 💪"
```

#### **🎯 Best Week/Period**
```
Template:
"🎯 Best Week: {dateRange} — {projects} new projects, {assets} assets, {actions} actions… are you okay? 😅"

Examples:
"🎯 Best Week: Oct 14–20 — 9 new projects, 24 assets, 146 actions… are you okay? 😅"
"🎯 Best Day: Jan 15 — 12 assets, 47 actions! Absolute madness! 🔥"

Variations by intensity:
// Ultra productive (100+ actions)
"🎯 Best Week: {date} — {stats} — absolute beast mode! 🦁"

// Very productive (50-99 actions)
"🎯 Best Week: {date} — {stats} — productivity on point! 🎯"

// Productive (20-49 actions)
"🎯 Best Week: {date} — {stats} — solid hustle! 💼"

Fallback (not enough data):
"🎯 Building momentum — the best is yet to come! 🚀"
```

### **3. 📊 Vertical Breakdown**

#### Section Header
```

// If balanced (no vertical >40%)
"Pretty balanced across categories — nice variety! 🎨"

// If 2 dominant verticals
"{vertical1} and {vertical2} are running the show, others are vibing along 🎭"

Examples:
"Loyalty's stealing the spotlight 🏆, Growth's chilling on the bench, Disco's still vibing 🪩"
"Growth and Disco are tied — competitive energy! ⚡"
```

#### Completion Rates per Vertical
```
Template per vertical:
"{verticalName}: {completedCount}/{totalCount} done ({percentage}%)"

Display:
"Loyalty: 5/8 done (63%) — making progress! 💛"
