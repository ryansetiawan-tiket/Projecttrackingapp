## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

If you're ready to implement this feature, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Review Planning
1. Read `00-overview.md` - Understand the feature
2. Review `01-ui-specifications.md` - Know what to build
3. Study `02-data-structures.md` - Understand the data
4. Check `04-example-mockups.md` - Visualize the result

### Step 2: Setup
1. Follow `03-implementation-plan.md` Phase 1
2. Create base components and file structure
3. Set up utility functions

### Step 3: Build Incrementally
1. Implement one tab at a time
2. Start with Overview (highest priority)
3. Move to Projects, then Assets, etc.
4. Test thoroughly after each phase

### Step 4: Polish
1. Add animations and transitions
2. Optimize performance
3. Ensure accessibility
4. Test on mobile devices

## 📊 Feature Summary

### What is Stats?
A comprehensive statistics dashboard that shows:
- **Overview**: Key metrics at a glance
- **Projects**: Distribution by status, vertical, type, quarter
- **Assets**: Breakdown by type, illustration type, folders
- **Collaboration**: Top collaborators, team distribution
- **Workflow**: Action statistics, completion rates
- **Timeline**: Deadlines, overdue projects, trends

### Why Build This?
- **Transparency**: Users see all their data
- **Insights**: Understand patterns and trends
- **Planning**: Make data-driven decisions
- **Monitoring**: Track progress and identify issues

### How It Works?
1. User clicks "Stats" in profile dropdown
2. Dialog opens with tabbed interface
3. Statistics are calculated from existing project data
4. Visual charts and cards display the data
5. Real-time updates as data changes

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### Client-Side Calculations
- All statistics calculated in the browser
- No backend changes required
- Uses existing React hooks (useProjects, useTeams, etc.)
- Memoized for performance

### Progressive Enhancement
- Implement in phases (Overview → Projects → Assets → etc.)
- Each tab is independent
- Can ship partial features
- Easy to add new tabs later

### Visual Design
- Uses existing component library (shadcn/ui)
- Matches current design system
- Responsive for mobile
- Accessible (WCAG AA compliant)

### Performance Considerations
- Memoized calculations
- Lazy loading for charts
- Optimized for 1000+ projects
- Loading skeletons for better UX

---

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **React** + **TypeScript** - Core framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **shadcn/ui** - UI components
- **Recharts** - Charts library
- **lucide-react** - Icons
