# GDrive Nested Folders - Quick Summary

**Question:** Can we add nested folder capability with each folder having its own GDrive link and preview images?

**Answer:** ✅ **YES! Absolutely possible and feasible!**

---

## 🎯 Approach

**Data Structure:** Parent Reference (Recommended)

```typescript
export interface GDriveAsset {
  id: string;
  asset_name: string;
  gdrive_link: string;
  asset_type: 'file' | 'folder';
  preview_urls?: GDrivePreview[] | string[];
  asset_id?: string;
  parent_id?: string | null; // 🆕 NEW FIELD (null = root level)
  created_at: string;
}
```

**Example:**
```typescript
// Root folder
{ id: 'folder-1', name: 'Final Designs', parent_id: null }

// Child folder
{ id: 'folder-2', name: 'Mobile Screens', parent_id: 'folder-1' }

// File in child folder
{ id: 'file-1', name: 'Login.png', parent_id: 'folder-2' }
```

## 📝 Open Questions

Before implementation, please confirm:

1. **Max Nesting Depth:**
   - Unlimited? Or limit to 5 levels?

2. **Delete Behavior:**
   - Cascade delete? Or require manual cleanup?

3. **Priority:**
   - MVP first (6-8 hours)?
   - Or full feature (18 hours)?

4. **UI Focus:**
   - Tree view (Manager)?
   - Navigation (Page)?
   - Both?

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Confirm requirements** (answer questions above)
2. **Start Phase 1** - Data structure & helpers
3. **Build incrementally** - Test each phase
4. **Iterate** - Add polish and enhancements
